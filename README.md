# Tunks keyboards
> Formerly: The project that will someday be the ultimate command center upgrade

This repo contains the Tunks series keyboard schematics, born as an experiment to make a macro keyboard for editing, gaming and testing mechanical switches.

## Roadmap

Companion app: a combination of hardware and software allowing the user to control programs like Discord and OBS as well as receive visual feedback in the form of "tally lights".
Keyboard shortcuts are fragile and unpredictable, and software like AutoHotKey is considered cheating software by a lot of anti-cheat utilities, regardless of what you do with it.
